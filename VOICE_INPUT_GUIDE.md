# Voice Input Feature Documentation

## Overview

Voice input functionality has been added to the chat interface, allowing users to ask questions using their microphone instead of typing. The feature uses the **Web Speech API** (built into modern browsers) for speech-to-text conversion.

## Features

‚úÖ **Voice Recognition**: Converts speech to text in real-time  
‚úÖ **Microphone Permission**: Automatically requests and checks microphone permissions  
‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Recording state with pulsing animation  
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for common issues  
‚úÖ **Browser Support Detection**: Automatically detects if browser supports speech recognition  
‚úÖ **Seamless Integration**: Works alongside traditional text input

## Files Added/Modified

### New Files:

1. **`src/hooks/useVoiceRecording.js`**
   - Custom React hook for voice recording
   - Manages Web Speech API lifecycle
   - Handles microphone permissions
   - Provides real-time transcript updates
   - Error handling for various scenarios

### Modified Files:

1. **`src/components/ChatInterface.jsx`**

   - Added microphone button next to send button
   - Integrated voice recording hook
   - Shows "Listening..." placeholder when recording
   - Updates input field with recognized speech
   - Dynamic hints based on recording state

2. **`src/components/ChatInterface.css`**
   - Styles for microphone button
   - Recording state animation (pulsing red)
   - Hover effects and disabled states
   - Responsive design considerations

## How It Works

### 1. User Flow

```
User clicks Mic button
    ‚Üì
Browser requests microphone permission
    ‚Üì
User grants permission
    ‚Üì
Recording starts (button turns red with pulse animation)
    ‚Üì
User speaks
    ‚Üì
Speech is converted to text in real-time
    ‚Üì
Text appears in input field
    ‚Üì
User clicks Mic button again (or speaks ends)
    ‚Üì
Recording stops, text ready to send
```

### 2. Technical Implementation

**Speech Recognition Setup:**

```javascript
const SpeechRecognition =
  window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition;
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();

recognition.continuous = false; // Stop after one phrase
recognition.interimResults = true; // Show results while speaking
recognition.lang = "en-US"; // English language
```

**Permission Handling:**

```javascript
await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
```

**Transcript Processing:**

```javascript
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  // Process both interim and final results
  // Update UI with transcript
};
```

## Browser Support

| Browser | Supported | Notes                                       |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Chrome  | ‚úÖ Yes    | Full support with `webkitSpeechRecognition` |
| Edge    | ‚úÖ Yes    | Full support with `webkitSpeechRecognition` |
| Safari  | ‚úÖ Yes    | iOS 14.5+ and macOS 11+                     |
| Firefox | ‚ùå No     | Web Speech API not yet supported            |
| Opera   | ‚úÖ Yes    | Based on Chromium                           |

**Note**: The microphone button only appears if the browser supports speech recognition.

## Usage Instructions for Users

### Basic Usage:

1. **Upload a PDF document** (if not already uploaded)
2. **Click the microphone button** (üé§) next to the send button
3. **Allow microphone access** when browser prompts
4. **Speak your question** clearly
5. **Click the microphone button again** to stop recording
6. **Review the text** in the input field
7. **Click send** to submit your question

### Tips for Best Results:

- üé§ **Speak clearly** and at a normal pace
- üîá **Minimize background noise** for better accuracy
- üó£Ô∏è **Wait a moment** after clicking mic before speaking
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit the text** if needed before sending
- üîÑ **Try again** if recognition fails

## Error Handling

The feature handles various error scenarios:

| Error           | Cause                          | User Message                                                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `no-speech`     | No voice detected              | "No speech detected. Please try again."                          |
| `audio-capture` | No microphone found            | "Microphone not found. Please check your device."                |
| `not-allowed`   | Permission denied              | "Microphone access denied. Please allow microphone permissions." |
| `network`       | Network issue                  | "Network error. Please check your connection."                   |
| `aborted`       | Recording stopped unexpectedly | "Recording was aborted."                                         |

## Visual States

### 1. Normal State (Not Recording)

- Gray background
- Gray microphone icon
- Hover: Light gray with purple border

### 2. Recording State

- Red gradient background
- White stop square icon
- Pulsing animation
- Input placeholder: "Listening..."

### 3. Disabled State

## Code Examples

### Using the Voice Hook:

```jsx
import useVoiceRecording from "../hooks/useVoiceRecording";

function MyComponent() {
  const {
    isRecording, // Boolean: currently recording
    transcript, // String: recognized text
    error, // String: error message if any
    isSupported, // Boolean: browser supports feature
    startRecording, // Function: start voice input
    stopRecording, // Function: stop voice input
    resetTranscript, // Function: clear transcript
  } = useVoiceRecording();

  // Use in your component
}
```

### Handling Transcript:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (transcript) {
    setInputValue(transcript); // Update input with recognized text
  }
}, [transcript]);
```

## Customization

### Change Language:

Edit `src/hooks/useVoiceRecording.js`:

```javascript
recognition.lang = "es-ES"; // Spanish
recognition.lang = "fr-FR"; // French
recognition.lang = "de-DE"; // German
```

### Change Recording Mode:

```javascript
// Continuous recording (doesn't auto-stop)
recognition.continuous = true;

// Only final results (no interim updates)
recognition.interimResults = false;
```

### Customize Styles:

Edit `src/components/ChatInterface.css`:

```css
.mic-button.recording {
  background: your-color;
  /* Custom animation */
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone button not appearing?

- Check if using supported browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Try HTTPS (some browsers require secure context)

### Permission denied?

- Check browser settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
- Ensure no other app is using the microphone
- Try refreshing the page

### Poor recognition accuracy?

- Check microphone quality
- Reduce background noise
- Speak more clearly and slowly
- Check microphone input levels in system settings

### Network error?

- Speech recognition may use online services
- Check internet connection
- Try again after a moment

## Security & Privacy

- ‚úÖ **Permission-based**: Requires explicit user permission
- ‚úÖ **No storage**: Audio is not stored or recorded
- ‚úÖ **On-demand**: Only active when user clicks mic button
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: Clear visual feedback when recording
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Online processing**: Speech recognition may use cloud services (browser-dependent)

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- [ ] Language selection dropdown
- [ ] Confidence score display
- [ ] Audio waveform visualization
- [ ] Support for continuous dictation
- [ ] Offline speech recognition (if browser supports)
- [ ] Voice commands (e.g., "send", "clear")
- [ ] Multi-language detection

## Dependencies

**None!** üéâ

This feature uses only native browser APIs:

- Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`)
- Media Devices API (`getUserMedia`)

No external libraries or API keys needed.
