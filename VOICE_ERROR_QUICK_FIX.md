# 🎤 Voice "Network Error" - Quick Fix Guide

## The Issue

Console shows:

```
Speech recognition error: network
```

---

## ✅ THE SOLUTION: Just Type Your Message!

Your **backend is working perfectly**! The error is from the browser's speech recognition service (Google Cloud), not your Django server.

---

## 🎯 Quick Fixes

### Fix 1: Use Text Input (Works Now!) ✅

1. **DON'T use the mic button**
2. **Type your question** in the input field
3. **Click send** 📤
4. **Get AI response** 🤖

**This works perfectly!** Your server logs prove it.

---

### Fix 2: Better Error Message ✅

I've updated the error message:

**Before:**

```
❌ "Network error. Please check your connection."
```

**After:**

```
✅ "Speech service unavailable. This feature requires
   an internet connection. You can still type your
   message below."
```

Now users understand:

- Speech service is the issue (not the whole app)
- They can type instead
- Backend is working fine

---

### Fix 3: Try Different Browser

Speech recognition works best in:

| Browser | Works?  |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome  | ✅ Best |
| Edge    | ✅ Good |
| Safari  | ✅ OK   |
| Firefox | ❌ No   |

**Try Chrome for best voice support.**

## 🔍 Why This Happens

```
Browser Speech API
    ↓
Tries to connect to Google's cloud
    ↓
Connection fails (slow internet, VPN, firewall)
    ↓
Error: "network"
```

**NOT related to your Django backend!**

## 📊 What's Working vs Not Working

### ✅ Working (Your Backend):

- Chat feature
- Document upload
- AI responses with Gemini
- RAG pipeline
- Source citations
- Conversation history

### ⚠️ Not Working (Browser API):

- Voice input (browser's speech recognition)

**Solution:** Just type! Everything else works. 🎉

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl + Shift + R)
2. **Try typing a message** (not voice)
3. **If typing works** → Backend is fine, just voice API issue
4. **If typing fails** → Let me know

Based on your logs, typing **will work perfectly**! ✅

## 📝 Files Updated

- `src/hooks/useVoiceRecording.js` - Better error messages

## 💡 Remember

Voice input is a **nice-to-have feature**, not required!

Your app works great with:

- ✏️ **Typing** (fully functional)
- 📄 **Document upload** (working)
- 🤖 **AI responses** (working)
- 📚 **Source citations** (working)

Only the **voice-to-text** has issues (browser's limitation).

---

**TL;DR**: Your backend is perfect! The "network error" is from browser's speech API trying to reach Google's servers. **Just type your messages** - everything works! 🚀
