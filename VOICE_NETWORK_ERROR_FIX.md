# 🎯 QUICK FIX: Network Error with Voice Input

## The Problem

You're seeing "Network error. Please check your connection." when using voice input.

**Good News**: Your backend is working perfectly! ✅  
The logs show successful requests at 13:56.

---

## ✅ Solution: It's the Voice Recognition, Not Your Backend!

The "network error" is coming from **browser's speech recognition**, not your backend.

### Why This Happens:

- Chrome/Edge use Google's cloud speech service
- If Google's service is slow or unreachable, it shows "Network error"
- Your backend API is fine (proven by successful requests in logs)

---

## 🔧 Immediate Fixes

### Fix 1: Try Regular Chat First (Bypass Voice)

**Test if backend works:**

1. **DON'T click the mic button**
2. **Type a message** manually
3. **Click send**
4. If you get a response → Backend is fine!

This confirms it's only the voice recognition having issues.

---

### Fix 2: Hard Refresh Browser

Voice recognition might be cached incorrectly:

**Windows:**

```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

**Or:**

```
Ctrl + F5
```

---

### Fix 3: Try Different Browser

Voice recognition works best in:

1. **Google Chrome** (best)
2. **Microsoft Edge** (good)
3. **Safari** (Mac/iOS only)

Firefox doesn't support it yet.

---

### Fix 4: Check Internet Connection

The speech recognition needs internet:

1. Open a new tab
2. Go to: `https://www.google.com`
3. If Google loads → Connection is fine
4. If slow → That's why voice is showing "Network error"

---

## 🎤 Voice Recognition is Optional!

**Important**: You can still use the chat without voice!

1. **Type your question** in the input field
2. **Click send button** 📤
3. **Get AI response** with sources

The voice feature is a bonus, not required.

---

## 🔍 Verify Backend is Working

### Test 1: Check API Directly

Open new browser tab:

```
http://localhost:8000/api/
```

You should see the API root page.

### Test 2: Upload Document

1. Go to your frontend
2. Upload a PDF
3. If upload works → Backend is fine ✅

### Test 3: Send Text Message

1. Type a question (don't use voice)
2. Click send
3. If you get an answer → Backend is fine ✅

---

## 📊 Your Current Status

Based on Django logs:

```
✅ Server Running: Port 8000
✅ Gemini API: Working
✅ RAG Pipeline: Working (found 5 chunks)
✅ AI Response: Successfully generated
✅ Database: Conversation saved
✅ FAISS: 68 vectors indexed
```

**Everything is working!** 🎉

## 💡 Understanding the Error

```
"Network error" appears when:

1. Browser's Speech Recognition
      ↓
   Tries to connect to Google's cloud
      ↓
   Connection is slow/blocked
      ↓
   Shows "Network error"

NOT related to:
❌ Your Django backend
❌ Your frontend code
❌ Your Gemini API
```

---

## ✅ Recommended Actions

### Action 1: Use Text Input (Proven Working)

```
1. Type your question
2. Click send
3. Get AI answer
```

This already works (proven by logs)!

### Action 2: Retry Voice Later

```
1. Close browser
2. Restart browser
3. Try voice again
```

### Action 3: Disable Voice Temporarily

If voice keeps showing errors, just don't use it:

- The mic button is optional
- Everything works fine with typing
